    <p id="para1"> The first and foremost emerging problem in the world is population explosion that directly impact in our environment 
        and every vital element of our environment such like water Tree,air,and  many other things . It causes poverty inflation of
         money, high price rate of daily commodities and creates thousands of problems which are too hard to solve us. On the other
          hand for being increased population growth we destroy our valuable natural resources and make a devastated impact for 
          ourselves.

        For the lacking of Trees and forest area CFC’S are increasing day by day for this reasons worlds temperature are 
        increasing which directly impact to melt polar ice caps and rise of sea levels which causes undergoing our firm land into 
        the water that directly impact a negative effect on our environment .It is true that by running or establishing an 
        atomic project which causes huge carbon dioxide gas in our environment though it’s a beneficiary side to create huge amount
         of energy but it has hundreds of harmful sides yet people of the rich country run these projects rather to stop the project 
         as a result we can easily notice the intensiveness of natural calamities at present year comparing the past year.

        Today it’s a normal matter to through our daily waste everywhere these waste melt and pollute our environment gradually
        and spread out jams for this reasons our local people get sick easily. Open waste pollute our environment as well as our 
        surroundings but everyone know about the bad effect of waste but do not take immediate steps to save their living area .
        At present the real situation are so dangerous that we hardly think because not only our land area but also our vast sea
        level area are polluted extremely, for this reasons our sea water get polluted and produce huge amount of toxic chemicals
        and that chemical fall a harmful effect in our sea living species . The industrial waste mismanagement is the main 
        responsible for this huge area pollution. If we can manage our industrial waste than we can save our sea level area
        as well our environment as we know sea is the big source of human food so it s a necessary duty to save our see as 
        much as possible.
